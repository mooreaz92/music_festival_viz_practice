    "\n",
    "The following is a personal project where publicly available tables containing music festival data are web scraped, combined, cleaned, and visualized in Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Objectives*\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will have five main objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Web scrape music festival data from Festival Alarm, a publicly available website that tracks music festival data (mainly in Europe)\n",
    "2. Combine the scraped data into a single table\n",
    "3. Perform a high-level analysis of the data and clean it as needed\n",
    "4. Export the data to Tableau and create visualizations for publication\n",
    "5. Document findings and analysis in a blog post\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *A note on web scraping*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flatiron school data science boot camp teaches it's students to always check the terms and conditions of a website before web scraping. Festival Alarm does not have a terms and conditions page, but it does have a privacy policy page (however, it is in German, so this was translated using Google Translate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The privacy policy page does not explicitly state that web scraping is not allowed, but it does state that the website is not to be used for commercial purposes.I reached out to the website owners and waited a week for their response; none was given. Since this project is for educational purposes only and there is no explicit statement against web scraping, I decided to proceed with the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone from Festival Alarm reads this and would like me to take down this project, please reach out to me and I will do so immediately. You can email me at mooreaz92@gmail.com or message me on GitHub."
